In this paper, an alternative methodology to obtain the strength ratio for the
laminated composite material is presented. Traditionally, classical lamination
theory and related failure criteria are used to calculate the numerical value of
strength ratio of laminated composite material under in-plane and out-of-plane
loading from a knowledge of the material properties and its layup. In this
study, to calculate the strength ratio, an alternative approach is proposed by
using an artificial neural network, in which the genetic algorithm is proposed
to optimize the search process at four different levels: the architecture,
parameters, connections of the neural network, and active functions. The results
of the present method are compared to those obtained via classical lamination
theory and failure criteria. The results show that an artificial neural network
is a feasible method to calculate the strength ratio concerning in-plane loading
instead of classical lamination and associated failure theory.

Traditionally, classic lamination theory is widely used to compute
properties of composite materials under in-plane and out-of-plane loading from
a knowledge of the material properties of the individual layers and the
laminate geometry. In this study, a systematic procedure is proposed to design
an artificial neural network for a practical engineering problem, which is
applied to calculate the strength ratio of a laminated composite material under
in-plane loading, in which the genetic algorithm is proposed to optimize the search
process at four different levels: the architecture, parameters, connections of
the neural network, and active functions.

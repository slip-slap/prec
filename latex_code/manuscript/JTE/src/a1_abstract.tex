In the present study,  a genetic algorithm methodological framework-based
optimization procedure is proposed to minimize thickness(or weight) of
midplane-symmetric composite laminate subject to in-plane loading. Fiber
orientation and ply thickness are chosen as design variables, and a variant of GA is 
employed to search for the optimal design of composite laminates.  To avoid
spurious laminate designs, both the Tsai-wu and the maximum stress criteria are
taken to determine whether load-bearing capacity is exceeded or not. Numerical
results are obtained and presented under different loading cases.

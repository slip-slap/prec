In the present study,  a genetic algoirthm methodological framework based
optimization procedure is proposed to minimizae thickness(or weight) of
midplane-symmetric composite laminate subject to in-plane loading. Fiber
orientation and ply thickness are chosen as design variables, and a variant of GA is 
employed to search the optimal design of composite laminates.  In order to avoid
spurious laminate designs, both the Tsai-wu and the maximum stress criteria are
taken to determine whether load bearing capacity is exceeded or not. Numberical
results are obtained and presented under different loading cases.

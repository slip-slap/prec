\section{Result}
In this experiment, the T300/5308 graphite/epoxy materials were used in the
lay-up sequence optimization, and it's properties as shown in
table.\ref{tab:T300/5308}. two constraints are imposed on the composite
laminates which are the safety factors $SF_{MS}$ , and safety factor $SF_{TW}$,
and the threshold value for both of them is 1. The constraint values of an
individual are $CV_1$ and $CV_2$. So the mutation vector here is a two
dimensional vector $[1 - CV_1, 1 - CV_2 ]$, and the coefficient of length
mutation $C_l$ and angle mutation $C_a$, respectively, chosen here is 20 and 10.

Figure \ref{fig:two_angles} (a) shows how the optimal individual's fitness and
strength ratio evolves during the GA process. The method to chose optimal
individual considering two following situations, if no individual in the current
population meets constraint, the one with biggest fitness is selected as the
optimal individual; if there are one or multiple individuals fullfils
requirement, the one with smallest fitness is chosen which means the smallest
one has the biggest priority.  Figure \ref{fig:two_angles} (b) shows how the two
distinct fiber orientation changes at the same time, and Figure
\ref{fig:two_angles} (c) displays how the number of each angles change.

At the beginning of this GA process, the fitness curves increased very quickly,
becasue of individual's strength ratio $CT_0$ is very small, so the difference
between the individual's fitness and the imposed constraint threshold is a big
positive number, so the range of mutaion length is from 0 to $C_l(CT_0 - CV_0)$.
The length of individual increases by n, which is random number between 0 and
$C_l(CT_0 - CV_0)$. As can be seen from Figure \ref{fig:two_angles} (a), both of
optimal individual's fitness and strength ratio increases very quickly.  The
range of mutaion angle is from 0 to $C_a(CT_0 - CV_0)$, and the number of every
angle also change violently. During this stage, increasing individual's length
playing a major role in increasing individual's fitness.

After a couple of generations, the optimal individual's fitness get bigger, and
the difference between individual's fitness and constraint threshold get
smaller. The range of mutaion length $[0, C_l(CT_0 - CV_0)]$ turn smaller. At
this stage, simply increase the individual's length doesn't make much difference
in improve individual's fitnees, and a better composite laminates lay-up can
dramaticly change the optimal individual's fitness. That's why the fitness curve
oscillated violently in this stage.  At the same time, the strength ratio curve
kept growing smoothly. But the growing speed got more smaller.

When GA comes to its last phase, GA found individuals that meet the constraint.
Now the optimal individual's fitness is greater than the safety factor. The
range of mutation length is from $C_l(CT_0 - CV_0)$ to 0. It means individuals
need to decrease it's length and improve its internal structure to meet the
constraint. That's why the fitness of optimal individual kept decreaing,
however, the strength ratio curve still is greater then safety factor.

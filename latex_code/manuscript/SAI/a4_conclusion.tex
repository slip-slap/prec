\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we reviewed GA, and CLT for the optimal design of composite
laminated materail. SAGA is proposed to search the optimal lay-up for laminated
composite under different loading. Two situations are considered under the same
loading, a set of two distinct angles, and three distinct angles, SAGA can
adjust its convergence speed depending on the difference of individual's
constraint value and constraint threshold.

\section{Experiment}
In the previous section we present the details of our strategies for designing an ANN. In
this section, we describe the details of training dataset prepartion, and evaluation.
\subsection{Dataset Preparation}
Equation \ref{equ:stress-strain} takes an analytical approach to model the
relationship between stress and strain. We sample this function to yield 14000 points
uniformly distributed over the domain space.

The range of in-plane loading is from 0 to 120; the range of fiber orientation $\theta$ is from
-90 to 90; ply thickness $t$ is 1.27mm, number of plies range $N$ is from 4 to 120;
Three different material is used in this experiment, as shown in table \ref{tab:mat}.
Figure \ref{tab:traing-data} shows part of the training data.

In order to speeds up the learning and accerlate convergence, the input
atttributes of the data set are rescaled to between 0 and 1.0 by a linear function.

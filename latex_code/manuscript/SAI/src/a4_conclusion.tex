\section{Conclusion}
We review the use of GA and ANN as an alternative approach for calculating the
strength ratio of an angle ply laminate under in-plane loading, traditionally,
which is obtained through CLT, and corresponding failure theories, such as
Maximum stress and Tsai-wu failure theories. To obtain optimal architecture, we
propose a two-layer ANN framework and four levels of evolution on the design of
ANN. It was demonstrated that ANN is an efficient and simple tool to compute
the strength ratio, instead of complex analytical mathematical model.


There are more improvements we can make over the search strategy and 
application in the area of laminated composite material. The future work is to
develop a more sophisticated ANN, which not only can predict the
properties for angle ply laminate, but also for the other type of laminated
composite material.

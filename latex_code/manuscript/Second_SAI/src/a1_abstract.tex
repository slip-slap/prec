The main challenge presented by the laminated composite design is the laminate
layup, involving a set of fiber orientations, composite material systems, and
stacking sequences. In nature, it is a combinatorial optimization problem that
can be solved by the genetic algorithm. In this present study, a new variant of
the genetic algorithm is proposed for the optimal design by modifying the
selection strategy.  To check the feasibility of a laminate subject to in-plane
loading, the effect of the fiber orientation angles and material components on
the first ply failure is studied. Then we compare the experimental results with
works in other literature.

The main challenge presented by the design of laminated composite material is
the laminate layup, involving a set of fiber orientations, composite material
systems, and stacking sequences. In nature, it is a combinatorial optimization
problem with constraints that can be solved by the genetic algorithm. The
traditional approach to solve a constrained problem is reformulating the
objective function. In the present study, a new variant of the genetic algorithm is
proposed for the design of composite material by using a mix of the selection
strategies, instead of modifying the objective function.  To check the
feasibility of a laminate subject to in-plane loading, the effect of the fiber
orientation angles and material components on the first ply failure is studied.
The algorithm has been validated by successfully optimizing the design of
cross-ply laminate under different in-plane loading cases. The results obtained
by this algorithm are better than works in related literature.

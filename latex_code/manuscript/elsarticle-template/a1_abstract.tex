In this study, a systematic methodological framework of artifical neural
network(ANN) design is proposed to obtain the optimal architecture to solve
practical engineering problems. Classic lamination theory(CLT) is widely used
for predicting the behavior of composite materials under in-plane loading from a
knowledge of the material properties of the individual layers and the laminate
geometry. ANN is suggested to approximate the CLT, and genetic algorithm is
introduced to optimize the architecture, parameters, and connections of the
neural network.

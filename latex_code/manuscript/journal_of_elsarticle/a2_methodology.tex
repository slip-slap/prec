\section{Evolution in EANN's}

Evolution in EANN can be divided into four different levels: topology, learning
rules, active functions, and connection weights. For the evolution of toplogy,
the aim is to find a optimal ANN architecture for a specfic problem. The
architecture of a neural network determines the information processing
capability in application, which is the foundation of the ANN. Two critical
issues are involved in the search process of an ANN architecture: the
representation and the search operators.

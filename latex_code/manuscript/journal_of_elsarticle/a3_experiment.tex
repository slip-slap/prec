\section{Experiment}
\subsection{Train Data Preparation}
Equation \ref{equ:stress-strain} takes an analytical approach to model the
relationship between stress and strain. We sample this function to yield 14000 points
uniformly distributed over the domain space.

The range of in-plane loading is from 0 to 120; fiber orientation range is from
-90 to 90; ply thickness is 1.27mm, number of plies range N is from 4 to 120;
Three different material is used in this experiment, as shown in table \ref{tab:mat}.

In order to speeds up the learning and accerlate convergence, the
training data is normalized through a min-max normalization trick.

Figure \ref{tab:traing-data} shows part of the training data.

The inputs of the neural network is consist of four parts: in-plane loading
$N_x$, $N_y$, and $N_{xy}$, design parameters of laminate, two distinct fiber
orientation angle $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$, ply thickness $t$, total number of
plies $N$; five engineering constants of composite materials, $E_1$, $E_2$, ;
five strength parameters of a unidirectional lamina. There are two outputs in
the neural network, safety factors for MS theory and Tsai-Wu theory, respectively.

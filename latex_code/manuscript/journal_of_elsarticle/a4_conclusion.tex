\section{Conclusion}
We have reviewed the use of GA and EANN's as an alternative for calcualating
the strength ratio based on MS and Tsai-wu failure theories. To find a
near-optimal ANN architecture automatically, four levels evolution are proposed
to be introduced into EANN's evolution process for approximating a target
function. Experiment studies were carried out for the training data and
indicated that evolved GNNs did generalise the target function.

There are more improvements we can make over our the search strategy and 
The future work is to develop a more sophisticated

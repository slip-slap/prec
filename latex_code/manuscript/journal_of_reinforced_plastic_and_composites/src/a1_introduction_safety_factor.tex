\subsection{Safety factor}
The safety factor, or yield stress, is how much extra load beyond is intended a
composite laminate will actually take, which is an indication of the material's
load carrying capacity. If the value is less then 1.0, it means failure. The safey factor is defined as 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:sr}SF=\frac{\text {Maximum Load Which Can Be
	Applied}}{\text {Load Applied}} {\textstyle .}
\end{equation}

The safety factor based on maximum stress theory is calculated by the following
method: first, the principal stresses($\sigma_1^k$,$\sigma_2^k$, and
$\tau_{12}^k$) are obtained by experiment; evaluate the safety factor along each
direction according to equation \ref{eq:sr}; The minimum value among these
safety factors are denoted as the safety factor of the lamina, $SF_{MS}^k$, it
can be written as 

\begin{align}
	SF_{MS}^k = \text{min of}
	\begin{cases}
		SF_X^k = 
		\begin{cases}
			\frac{X_t}{\sigma_{11}}, \text{ if } \sigma_{11}>0 \\
			\frac{X_c}{\sigma_{11}}, \text{ if } \sigma_{11}<0 \\
		\end{cases} \\
		SF_Y^k = 
		\begin{cases}
			\frac{Y_t}{\sigma_{22}}, \text{ if } \sigma_{22}>0 \\
			\frac{Y_c}{\sigma_{22}}, \text{ if } \sigma_{22}<0 \\
		\end{cases} \\
		SF_S^k =
		\begin{cases}
			\frac{S}{|\tau_{12}|} \\
		\end{cases} \\
	\end{cases} \textstyle{.}
\end{align}


Assuming the composite laminate under a in-plane loading f, the corresponding
stress on local stress in direction 1, local stress in direction 2, and shear
stress for the kth lamina are $\sigma_1 SF_{TW}^k$, $\sigma_2SF_{TW}^k$, and $\tau_{12}SF_{TW}^k$,
respectively. Substitute them into the equation \ref{eq:tsai_wu}, the expression
are given by

$a(SF_{TW}^k)^2 + b(SF_{TW}^k) - 1 = 0 \textstyle{,}$

where 


$a = H_{11}(\sigma_1)^2 + H_{22}(\sigma_2)^2 +H_{66}(\tau_{12})^2 +
2H_{12}\sigma_1 \sigma_2 \textstyle{,} $


$b = H_1\sigma_1 + H_2 \sigma_2 + H_6 \tau_{12} \textstyle{.}$ 


Solve the above equation, the safety factor for the kth lamina is 

$SF_{TW}^k = |\frac{-b+ \sqrt{b^2 + 4a}}{2a}|$.

Then, the minimum of $SF_{TW}^k$ is taken as the safety factor of the
laminate which is written as

$SF_{TW}= \text{ min of } SF_{TW}^k \text{ for } k=1,2,\cdots, m-1,m$ .

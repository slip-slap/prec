The main challenge presented by the laminate composite design is the laminate
layup, involving a set of fiber orientations, composite material systems, and
stacking sequences. In nature, it is a combinatorial optimization problem that
can be solved by the genetic algorithm (GA). In this present study, a new
variant of the GA is proposed for the optimal design by modifying the selection
strategy.  To check the feasibility of a laminate subject to in-plane loading,
the effect of the fiber orientation angles and material components on the first
ply failure is studied.  An optimal composite material and laminate layup is
well-established for a targeted strength ratio, which compromises weight and
cost through an improved genetic algorithm. The numerical results are obtained
and presented for different loading cases.

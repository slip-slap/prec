\section{Experiment}
First, we formulate a constrained problem by searching the optimal stacking
sequence of cross-ply laminate under in-plane loading whose strength ratio is
not less than 2.  Each lamina dimensions $1000 \times 1000 \times 0.165 mm^3$
is adopted in this experiment, each graphite/epoxy,  and glass/epoxy layer is
assumed to cost 2.5 and 1 monetary units, respectively. The other material
properties are shown in Table \ref{tab:mat}. 


\subsection{Problem formulation}

In the present experiment, the optimal composite sequences, and the number of
layers for a targeted strength ratio under in-plane loading conditions are
investigated.  The aim is to minimize the mass of a laminate composite for a
targeted strength ratio based on the Tsai-wu failure theory. The design
variables are the ply angles and the number of layers.  Ply orientation
restricted to a discrete set of angles ($0, \text{ and } 90 \text{ degrees} $).
The problem can be formulated as the following equation

Find: $\{\theta_k, n\}$ $\theta_k \in \{ 0,90\}$

Minimize: weight

Subject to: strength ratio


\subsection{GA Operation}

\input{fig/ga_operator.tex}
In the present study, floating encoding is adopted to represent a solution for
the lay-up design of cross-ply laminate, Figure \ref{GA:operator}(a) shows two
parents $P_1$ and $P_2$ which represent two cross-ply laminates, the
corresponding laminates lay-ups are $[0_3/90_7]$ and $[0_6/90_4]$,
respectively. Figure \ref{GA:operator}(b) shows two offspring of parents $P_1$
and $P_2$ which are consist of half of each parent's chromosome.

Figure \ref{GA:operator} shows the mutation operations which consists of
length mutation and angle mutation operation for the chromosome. For the chromosome length
mutation, calculate the chromosome's strength ratio based on its sequence, if
its strength ratio is less than the threshold, then increase its length. A length
mutation coefficient is introduced to adjust the length mutation.  As
shown in figure \ref{GA:operator}(b), the strength ratio of $O_1$ chromosome is
0.0854, and the strength ratio threshold is 2. Suppose the length mutation
coefficient takes 2, then the corresponding increase length is $2
\times(2-0.0854)$. For the angle mutation, randomly swap the gene from
0 to 90 in the chromosome, or the otherwise.


\subsection{GA Parameters}
Table \ref{tab:ga} shows related GA parameters: the population is 40, and 50
percent is as the mating pool, so the parent population is 20; as
shown in figure \ref{fig:percentage}, the percentage of active individuals from
the active group, potential individuals from the potential group, and proper
individuals from the proper group are 0.3, 0.3, and 0.4, which means the
corresponding number of these three types of individuals are 6, 6, and 8,
respectively.

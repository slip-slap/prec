\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, we reviewed the use of the proposed GA framework, classical lamination
theory, and Tsai-wu failure theory for the design of optimal cross ply laminate
sequence. Because GA is designed for unconstrained  problem which is not
suitable for a constrained problem, therefore, we proposed an unconstrained
approach to solve a constrained problem.

This variant of the GA provides a new approach to address the search constraint in laminate composite
optimization, and this method is very easy to extend for solving the multiple constraint search problem in other
domains. The problem with the current method involves adjusting the parameters in the GA to obtain the best
performance.

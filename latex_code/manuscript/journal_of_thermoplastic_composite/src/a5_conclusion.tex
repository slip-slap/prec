\section{Conclusions}
In this paper, a combination of CLT and a variant of the GA are employed to minimize the weight and cost
of a single-material and hybrid composite laminate, respectively, under various in-plane loading
cases. The results are presented in two sections: stacking sequence optimization for a single material
laminate, and weighted mass and cost optimization of a carbon/epoxy, graphite/epoxy, and
glass/epoxy hybrid laminates. Furthermore, the performance of the basic GA is improved by changing the
selection strategy.

This variant of the GA provides a new approach to address the search constraint in laminate composite
optimization, and this method is very easy to extend for solving the multiple constraint search problem in other
domain. The problem with the current method involves adjusting the parameters in the GA to obtain the best
performance.

Studying in Japan is a bitter but beautiful, and fruitful journey for the last
three years, as far as I am concerned, during which my professor provide us
rather lenient environment for research, and I gained a lot from this
experience. Especially, I am so grateful for my professor intolence for my poor
english at the beginning.

The initial period here is the toughest that I got through of the three years,
since I can't speak, and read Japanese at all. During this time, even eating
outside in a local restaurant is very difficult for me to get it done, and I
can't do anything on my own. Thank you to all my friends for providing precious
help to get me settle down in Japan. After that, I learn some basic Japanese,
the culture and history about Japan, and gradually get used to live here.  I got
understand Japanese way of thinking, providing me a brand-new perspective to
understand the world, until two the second year I learn Japanese.  

Thank you for this wonderful journey in Japan, I grow up a lot.

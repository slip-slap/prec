\subsection{Conclusion}
In this paper, we reviewed the use of variant GA for the optimal design of composite
laminated material under in-plane loading based on Tsai-wu and maximum stress
failure criteria. GA is proposed to search the optimal lay-up for laminated
composite under different loading cases. Two situations are considered under the same
loading, a set of two distinct angles, and three distinct angles. 

By setting the constant values of length mutation coefficient and angle mutation
coefficient at the beginning, the convergence speed of the search process can be
controlled in an explicit way; During the optimization process, GA can adjust
its length mutation range and angle mutation range based on the difference
between individual's constraint values and constraint thresholds.  

Finally, comparison of previous research and current result are presented. In
some cases, the proposed GA in this paper is better off than DSA method.
However, there is still many works to study within this GA, such as the
fine-tuning of parameters taken in this GA.

\section{Conclusion}
We review the use of genetic algorithms and artificial neural networks as an
alternative approach for calculating the strength ratio of an angle ply
laminate under in-plane loading, traditionally, which is obtained through CLT,
and corresponding failure theories, such as Maximum stress theory and Tsai-wu
failure theory. To obtain optimal architecture, we propose a two-layer ANN
framework and four levels of evolution on the design of ANN.  It was
demonstrated that ANN is an efficient and simple tool to compute the strength
ratio, instead of the complex analytical mathematical model. Our findings
underline the practical applicability of ANN on the analysis of composite
material.
